{{#if showCorrectCode}}
  <div>You must add a closing “}” at the end of your file:</div>
  <p class="reduce-padding">
  {{my-ivy-codemirror
    value=correctCode
    codeSnippet=true
    options=(hash lineWrapping=true
                  readOnly=true)}}
  </p>
{{else}}
  <p>
    This kind of error can typically occurs because you forgot to close something.
    The compiler only realizes the problem at the end of the file, so the line number
    might not be helpful in this case.
  </p>
  <div><b>TIP</b>: Try checking whether you have any unbalanced “}” or “)” within your function</div>
